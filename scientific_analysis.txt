Analyze the experimental data and return results as a JSON object where each key is the question and the value is the answer:

1. What is the average temperature for positive results?
2. What is the average temperature for negative results?
3. How many samples had positive results?
4. What is the highest concentration recorded?
5. Which sample has the lowest pH value?
6. What percentage of samples were positive?
7. What is the average pressure across all samples?
8. Is there a correlation between temperature and result outcome?
