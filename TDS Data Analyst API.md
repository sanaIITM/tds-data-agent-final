PROJECT TITLE
TDS Data Analyst Agent – Fully Compliant Implementation for Evaluation

OBJECTIVE
Create and deploy a Python API that:
* Accepts a problem statement in a text file (questions.txt) plus optional attachments.
* Sources data (web scrape, uploaded files, or both).
* Prepares, analyzes, and visualizes the data.
* Uses LLMs via AI Pipe for reasoning or code generation if needed.
* Returns results in the exact format required by the evaluator, within 3 minutes.
The solution must pass the evaluator’s automated scoring and visual rubric checks.

Base URL:

https://aipipe.org/openai/v1
Models:
* gpt-4.1-nano for quick reasoning
* gpt-4o-mini for more complex analysis
Environment variables in code:
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<token>"
os.environ["OPENAI_BASE_URL"] = "https://aipipe.org/openai/v1"
3. API ENDPOINT
* POST /api/
* Request format:
    * questions.txt → Always present, main problem statement
    * Zero or more additional files (.txt, .csv, .json, .png, .jpg, .pdf, .zip, .tar.gz, .parquet, .xlsx)
* Must handle .zip and .tar.gz by extracting recursively into a temp folder.
* Must parse questions.txt to decide:
    * Whether to scrape external data (e.g., Wikipedia).
    * Whether to process local files only.
    * Whether to combine web + local.

4. DATA SOURCING & PROCESSING
* Web scraping: Use requests + BeautifulSoup for structured pages.
* Local files:
    * .csv/.xlsx → pandas.read_csv/read_excel
    * .json → pandas.read_json or json lib
    * .parquet → duckdb or pandas.read_parquet
    * .zip/.tar.gz → extract, then process extracted files
* For Indian High Court dataset:Use DuckDB queries to read .parquet and calculate delays, counts, etc.

5. OUTPUT FORMATS
Case A: 4-element JSON array
[ <int>, "<string>", <float>, "data:image/png;base64,..." ]
* Element 0: Integer (e.g., 1)
* Element 1: String containing a keyword (case-insensitive) — e.g., "Titanic"
* Element 2: Float accurate to ±0.001 — e.g., 0.485782
* Element 3: Base64-encoded PNG (< 100 KB) with:
    * Scatterplot of Rank (x-axis) vs Peak (y-axis)
    * Dotted red regression line (linestyle=":", color="red")
    * Axes labeled clearly
    * Save as PNG, compress if >100 KB
Case B: JSON object
{
  "Which high court disposed the most cases from 2019 - 2022?": "...",
  "What's the regression slope ...": "...",
  "Plot the year ...": "data:image/webp;base64,..."
}
6. EVALUATION CRITERIA
The evaluator runs Python checks:
# 1. Must be a 4-element JSON array for certain tasks
type(output) == list and len(output) == 4

# 2. First element exact match
output[0] == 1

# 3. Second contains 'titanic'
"titanic" in output[1].lower()

# 4. Third float accuracy
abs(output[2] - 0.485782) <= 0.001

# 5. Fourth passes visual rubric:
# (a) Scatterplot Rank vs Peak
# (b) Dotted red regression line
# (c) Labeled axes
# (d) Size < 100 KB
If any fails → 0 score.

7. PERFORMANCE RULES
* Must complete in ≤ 180 seconds total.
* Must handle:
    * Large parquet files (stream read if possible)
    * Missing internet gracefully (return safe default)
* All file handling must be secure (no arbitrary path writes).
8. DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
* Single command to run:
python run.py
Files:
* app.py (FastAPI)
* run.py (entrypoint)
* requirements.txt
* README.md with usage & deploy steps
* LICENSE (MIT)
Deploy on Render:
* Web Service → Python → Start Command: python run.py
* Environment vars:
OPENAI_API_KEY=<token>
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1
9. ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
* Use try/except around:
    * Web scraping (handle 404s, redirects)
    * File parsing (unsupported formats → skip)
    * LLM calls (retry on failure)
* Always return only JSON (no extra logs or text in response).
* Ensure plot generation is deterministic (no random jitter in output).

Instruction to AI Coder:
Build the complete project exactly as described above. The output must strictly match the evaluator’s expected JSON structure and formatting. All edge cases (missing data, compressed files, offline mode) must be handled gracefully. Ensure the project passes automated checks and visual rubric verification.

### **🆘 Need Help?**
If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check the [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](cci:7://file:///Users/anony/Desktop/PROJECT_WINDSURF/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md:0:0-0:0)** I created for detailed troubleshooting
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly in Render
3. **Monitor build logs** in the Render dashboard
4. **Test locally first** with `python run.py` to ensure everything works

### **🔥 Ready to Deploy?**

- ✅ Tested all functionality thoroughly
- ✅ Verified evaluator-compliant output formats
